    <string name="about_msg">&lt;b>SlidingMenu&lt;/b> is an Open Source Android library 
        that allows developers to easily create applications with sliding menus like those 
        made popular in the Google+, YouTube, and Facebook applications. 
        You can find it on GitHub by clicking the little octocat icon in the ActionBar. 
        Feel free to use it all you want in your Android apps provided 
        that you cite this project and include the license in your app.
        &lt;br>&lt;br>
		SlidingMenu is currently used in some incredibly popular Android 
		apps such as Zappos, Plume, VLC for Android, and The Verge. 
		If you are using SlidingMenu in your app and would like to be 
		listed here, please let me know via Twitter (@slidingmenu)!</string>
